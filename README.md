# GBTS - Game Boy Emulator

This is a WIP emulator of the original Nintendo Game Boy, written in TypeScript with minimal run-time dependencies.

I've been following a variety of resources in the following repo to get what I currently have here: https://github.com/avivace/awesome-gbdev

## Quickstart
Run the app from https://ntarelix.github.io/gbts/ or clone the repo and run the following commands:

1. `npm install && npm start`
2. Open http://localhost:8080 in browser

## Goals

My initial goal is to be able to play Tetris because it's supposedly one of the simplest games to emulate. I'm keeping track of the various tasks necessary to achieve this goal via a GitHub project.
